Remember, in each turn, players roll six dice and try to score as many points as possible. They can choose to set aside scoring dice and roll the remaining ones to continue accumulating points, but if they roll and don't get any scoring dice, they lose all points accumulated in that turn. The game continues until a player reaches a set point goal, typically 10,000 points or another predetermined target.
