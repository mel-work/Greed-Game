## Turns and Rounds
Each player takes a `turn` rolling the dice to see how many points they can get. Each turn will consist of various rounds within the turn. 

## Game Format
Once a new game is created, an embed will pop up asking people to click the button to join the game.
`Game starting...` Use Discord timestamp for `In 60 seconds`

The game will be in a single embed that updates each round and turn.
